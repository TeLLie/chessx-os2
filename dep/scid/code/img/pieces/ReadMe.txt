This folder contains the set of pieces that can be used in Scid.

Each subfolder identifies a set and contains the images used for the various dimensions of the board.
Images can be provided in gif or png format (png require tcl/tk version 8.6 or version 8.5 with optional tkimg package).

Most images used here were generated from freeware chess fonts available in TrueType format at the En Passant website "Chess Fonts" page
http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/fonteng.htm
Copyright notice for the images should be specified in a copyright file within each folder.

Each picture contains all the pieces (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king) for both color and must comply with the specified size.
For example:
myownpieceset_40.gif must be an image with length 480 (40 x 12) and 40 pixels height.
myownpieceset_70.gif must be an image with length 840 (70 x 12) and 70 pixels height.
etc..

You can easily add your own set simply adding a directory with your favourite images: the new set will be available the next time Scid starts.

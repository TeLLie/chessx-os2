- Game info area: show transcription of custom flags.

1) turn on the "Show Suggested Move" option.
2) create a new game
3) start an engine
4) click on a white pawn with the mouse and move it fast around the 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

So, truncating games by removing leading moves has at least two bugs:
1. NAGs are removed.
2. Optional tags (WhiteElo, BlackElo) are removed.

-- use srand() but should already use system clock?


Is there a way to set the seed for the random number generator used by Scid?
Now it appears that each time Scid is restarted, the training mode (togglable
from the tree window) plays the same moves as the previous time when I'm using
the same database.

* In docked mode board rotation breaks piece animation for autoplay
* Check for bases/books dir not upon startup but once the related
  function is called for the first time.
* Opening Trainer picks up type of DB only after restart of Scid(?)
* Blunder check in tactical game should be for the players moves not
  for phalanx moves.

- I would like the "games" window to display the continuation from the
current position, rather than the opening from move one (something I
find rather useless).  Is there a way to effect this?  If not, being
something of a programmer, I might turn my hand to making it possible.

- when engine analysis is in locked mode so that the engine remains analyzing a certain position while the board is changed, the "V" buttons are disabled and that makes it impossible to ever have results of a locked-down engine analysis inserted into the game score

- Switch sides button for game play instead of automatically switching
  of sides by board rotation.  (komyt@yahoo.com)

- Given a list of names create the proper set of empty games to set up
  a tournament. (Suggested by Michael Blake)

- Notify games with annotations in "Best game", show annotator there.
  Consider sort order: e.g. annotated games on top?

- Merge games including NAGs / variants(?)

- Allow to save the list from the tournament finder. Drop restriction
  to 1000 games for this save.

- In spell checker: give more information in case of ambiguous names.
  E.g. first line of SSP-file or %Bio lines will help to sort things
  out.

- Spell check, ambiguous names: In case of multiple hits, drop limit
  of the first 10, more should be allowed here.

- Add more complete header to browse game.

- improve commentary arrows: thicker, starting form the real middle of
  the field, ending at the middle of the field, get a thin black
  frame.

- Add a Game training ala Fritz' "Friend mode"

- use tablelist package to revamp Game List window

- Start game analysis at the end of the game to fill hash tables

- Engines tournament (with specific opening line ?)

- book generation from Scid (re-use of Polyglot code)

- Export Tournament grid in XML

- Comment Editor: make toggle for the tiny board (Esteban Cervetto)

- When merging game A into game B, A is added as a new variation. Is this a conscious choice? It seems illogical to me. For example: if game B is analysis of an opening variation, it's not possible to add a newly played game to a non-main variation of the analysis. Workaround: manually change the appropriate variation into the main line, merge games, and change back to the original main line.

- Is is possible to include variations when merging? Practical examples: adding an analysed game (with relevant notes) to a game which consists of opening analysis; adding an pgn-update of an existing opening book to the original analysis; merge multiple analysis of the same position (different pupils of the same teacher, shared analysis among friends).

- Is it possible to merge multiple games at ones?
